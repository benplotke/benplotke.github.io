			<h2>Trebuchet</h2>
			<div class="description">
				Built a 21' trebuchet from scrap in the mountains. Not having internet, I had only this book as my guide. The most helpful parts were the 2 historical drawings.

			<h2>Tetrahedral</h2>
			<div class="description">
				Independently proved the tetrahedral angle. Learning basic cemistry at the same time I was taking precalc, I became intrigued by the tetrahedral angle. I then independently developed a proof.

			<h2>Huffman</h2>
			<div class="description">
				Dissatisfied with simply making a huffman coder to strings of 1s and 0s, I asked my professor if I could encode bytes to a file. With permission, I made a huffman coder that could take any file and huffman code and decode it.

			<h2>Convergence</h2>
			<div class="description">
				Colaborated with pure mathematician. My friend Sam asked me to do a sanity check on his math discovery. Checking the converging series to a million terms involved one million factorial.
